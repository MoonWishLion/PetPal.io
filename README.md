# PetPal.io

Welcome to PetPal~! Where your pets go to find romance, heartache, and maybe even that special someone.

## Inspiration
Our group was inspired to do a silly hack off of the idea of Tinder, but for pets! 

## What It Does
This app should let your pet create a profile, look through others' images and information, and store other pets as possible friends or blind romances!

## How We Built It
We built this app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on Repl.it, while collaborating the different pages and pieces on GitHub. Additionally, we used the GitHub Student Developers' Pack to host the website's domain. 

## Challenges We Ran Into
We initially had difficulty narrowing our focus down to a single, silly, and feasible project within the timeframe provided. Other issues involved setting up the mobile application of the product, as well as coordinating roles through several different timezones. Despite this, we overcame numerous challenges in order to release a fun webapp for this hackathon, and we enjoyed the challenge, tremendously.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We are proud to have a (mostly) completed project, built with some tools we learned during the hackathon, to show off! :D 

## What We Learned
We learned how to constrain our ideas to a smaller timeframe in order to have a working prototype, as well as how to try out new platforms outside of our comfort zone. We researched machine learning, authorization pages, website development, and graphic design throughout this hackathon, but ended up with something much smaller and cuter than before. 

(Be on the lookout for a deep-fake dress-up game and storyteller, though — one day!)

## What's Next for PetPal
We plan to streamline the product and rid it of any bugs or work through any fixes it needs, before we make it available for use for free. The website will be completed soon, followed by the mobile application. Who knows; we may even decide to incorporate other API's and market it as a finished product!
